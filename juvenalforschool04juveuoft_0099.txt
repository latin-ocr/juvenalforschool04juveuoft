192-235 How can they be said to have escaped, whom con-
science scourges? ’Tis a punishment more cruel than any de-
vised by Caedicius or Rhadamanthus, to be haunted night and
day by an accuser in one's own breast. The Pythian priestess
wax-ned the Spartan Glaukos, who had asked, whether or no he
should break trust and maintain the cheat by perjury, that he
would not escape vengeance. So he retumed the deposit; but
as his honesty was due to sear, not to principle, he and all his
house were swept away. Such is the retribution due to the
mere intention of sinning; for he who designs a sin, is guilty of
the act. What if he have executed it? he is in constant terror ;
the daintiest wine cannot drown his care. If he sall into a doze,
the god whose altar he has violated‚ the man whom he has
wronged, rise before him in his dreams and drive him to consess.
Every flash of lightning seems to such men aimed point-blank at
them; every attack of disease a judgement on their sins. They
dare not bring an offering in their stead; sor what hope is there
sor the guilty? What victim but is worthier to live?
