s 86—119 Some make chance all in all, and believing in no
ruler of the world, swear without a shudder by any altar you
please. Another believes that there are gods, and yet sorecasts
thus with himself. ‘ With my body let Isis deal as she will, and
with angry rattle strike blindness upon my eyes, is only even
sightless I may clutch the soresworn coin. 'Tis worth while to
buy wealth by consumption, rotten sores and a crippled thigh.
Let Ladas, is not stark-inad‚(11eeding hellebore of Anticyra or
prescriptions of Archigenes) not hesitate in his need to pray sor
the rich man's gout: sor what is he the better for the fame of
fleetness and the hunger·starved branch of Olympia's olive-
wreath? Can he feast on praise? The wrath of the gods may
be heavy, it is assuredly tardy: if they are concerned to punish
all the guilty, when will my turn come round? Besides I may
perchance, as Some (lo. appease their wrath; is one man's crimes
bring him to a cross, another's win a crown.' Thus the perjuret
steels his beart against sear, nay drags you to the temple to hear
his oaths: acting a sarce all the time, like the runaway buffoon
in Catullus. You shout like Stentor or Mars in Homer: ‘ Iup-
piter, dost thou hear and yet not move the lip, when thou should'st
speak even though of stone or brass? Else why do we drop
incense and offer heifer’s liver and hog's caul on thy altar? For
aught I see, choice there is nonebetween the images of you gods
and the statue of Vagellius)
