I 66 XV 93—100

93-131 The Vascones too once sed on human flesh, but
they could plead necessity: nothing short of such pitiable (97)
extremity ean palliate such guilt: again, the Vascones were an
untaught tribe3 Egypt in common with the rest of the world
(110) has now some culture, and yet is rnore eruel than Diana
Taurica, sor her human victims are not eaten after death. These
Egyptians were in no extremity, and yet (122) their crime was
as heinous, as could be occasioned even by the famine which
would ensue if the Nile should withhold its waters; in them,
though an effeminate race (126), the impulses of passion are no
less desperate, than those of famine in others.

VASCONES (cf. ¹²4 Brilffnes. Οὐάσκωνες Strabo; Οὐάσκονες
Ptol. now the Easque nation) between the Ebro and Pyrenees in
the modern Navarra and Guipuzcoa. cf. Pmdent. perist. 1 94
iamne credis, bruta quondam Vasconum gentilitas? One
of the chief towns among the Vascones was Calagurris (Cala—
horra) a municipium on the Ebro, the birth-place of Quintilian.
Hence Sertorius B.C. 75 repelled Metellus (109) and Pompeius

of Sertorius B.C. 72 Oros. V 23 Calagurrim Afranius iugi
