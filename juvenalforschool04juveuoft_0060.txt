'75 INCLUSA PER AEQUORA Mores cf. 80 n. schol. ‘portum
Augusti dicit sive Traiani ; quia Traianus portum Augusti restau-
ravit in melius et interius tutiorem sui nominis fecit.’ Trajan
‘ added an inner basin or dock, of a hexagonal form, surrounded
with quays and extensive ranges of buildings for magazines‘
(Bunbury in dict. geogr. who gives a plan). The original work
does great honour to the emperor Claudius DCass. LX 1 1 ξ 3 ‘he
conceived and carried out an achievement worthy of the enter-
prise (φρονήματος) and greatness of Rome.' Ostia lay on the left
bank of the lest (i. e. the broader southern) arm of the Tiber.
Claudius dug a safer basin about two miles N. of Ostia communi-
cating With the river by a new cut (afterwards enlarged by
Trajan, fossa Traiana, now Fimnzkino, the right arm). The
port protected by two vast moles, right and left, with a break-
water surmounted by a lighthouse between them, was known as
portus Romanus or portus A agusti. Strabo 231 232 calls Ostia
‘a city without a port, on account of the alluvial deposits con-
tinually brought down by the Tiber, which compelled the larger
vessels to ride at anchor in the open roadstead at great risk,
while their cargoes were unloaded into bmges, by which they
were carried up the river to Rome. Other vessels were them-
selves towed up the Tiber‚ aster they had been lightened by
discharging a part of their cargoes.’ Suet. Claud. 20 portum
Ostiae exstruxit circumducto dextra sinistraque bracchio
et acl introilum prcfimdo iam sale m ole obiecta ,· quam qno stabilius
fimdaret, navem ante dmum-sit, qua magnus obeliscus ex Aegypto
suerat advectus, congestisque pilis snpeaposuit altissimam
turrim in exemplum Alexandrini phari, ut adnocturnos
ignes cursum navigia dirigerent.

MOLES ‘ moles carried out amidst enclosed seas.'
