XII

Tms satire, as several others (vi 21. v111 1. XI 5. x111 5. 33.
XIV 1. xv 1) is in the form osan epistle. In it, asin XI, we see
Iuv. at home. His love of nature and of simplicity appears ‚in
1-14‚ 83—92‚ as in 111 18—20, 226—231. lx 60—1. XIV 166

der 12. Satire von Juvenal. Putbus 1877 4to. Progr. n⁰. 104)
conjectures that the passage 24—82 is a pmody, introduced by
the warning POETICA SURGrr TEMPESTAS, of the extravagant
descriptions of storms in which contemporary poetasters piled
horror on horror. Certainly the inventory of Catullus' wares
37—47 is as exaggerated as anything in Lucan ; yet Iuv. every-
where betrays a want of proportion and sacrifices the whole to
the parts: individual excellences must atone sor the failure of
the general effect.

To-day‚ Corvinus, I keep holy to the godS‚ who have de-
livered Catullus; nor, were my means equal to my affection,
would 1 withhold the costliest offerings (1—16). For, after
encountering all the perils of a storm, and cheerfully sacrificing
his treasures to lighten the ship, he has reached in sasety our
new harbour(17—92). ΧΥοηάεῐ not then at my rejoicing, nor
question its sincerity: he, for whom I raise so many altam, is no
orbus, that a fortune-humer should pay him court: even those
who would offer their own children 011 the altar to propitiate the
childless rich, would think any the smallest attention thrown
away upon the father os three sons (93—130). With 1—92 cf.
Catull. 9. Hor. c.1 36. 117. 111 14. Stat. s. 11 7. Mart. x
87; with 93—130 Hor. s. 11 5. Luc. dial. mort. 5—9. Ob-
bar on Hor. ep. 1 1 78.

1—16 To-day, Corvinus, is sweeter to me than a birthday.
To-day I perform the promised vow to the three gods of the
Capitol, snow-white lambs to Iuno and Minerva, to Iuppiter a
calf just weaned; if my fortune were as my love, a sat bull from
{he Clitumnus should prove my gratitude sor my friend’s de-
iverance.
