the world should go to ruin, merely to resute you? est tanti,

turns out better men, mind and body, than Plutos: παριὶ τῷ

with you, dines on oysters, truffles, sow's paunch, boar; is often
drunk on Setine and Falernian, and drinks only Caecuban in
iced water: circumfusa rosis et nrgrra recumbit amomo, Ι dormit

97 LADAS there were two Olympic victors of this name:
one probably an Argive, victor in the δόλιχος (near the Eurotas
Paus. ΠΙ 21 ξ 1 Λᾴδα μνῆμαί ἐστιν ἁκύτητι υπερβαλλομένου ποδῶν
τοὺς ἐφ’ αὑτοῦ); the other an Achaean of Aegium, victorin the
στάδιον (ib.), in the 125th Ol. B.C. 281 (id. x 23 ἓ 14). The
more famous Argive had a statue in the temple of the Lykian
Apollo at Argos (id. 11 19 ἓ 7). another by Myro is celebrated
in the anthol. (cited on 99). In Arkadia, near Petrosaka, was
shewn (Paus. v111 12 3* 5) Λςίδα. στάδιον, ἐς ὃ ἐποιεῖτο Λᾴδας με-
λέτην δρόμου. Some suppose that Myro’s statue was in Olym-
pia, but removed to Rome before the time of Paus. which would
account sor his silence respecting it and for the familiarity of
Roman writers with the name. 'I'he fleetness of L. became pro-
verbial. Catull. 55 ²4 ²5 non si Pegaseo ferar volatu. j non La-

contemporary of Martial’s may have assumed the name.

ANTICYRA a poor man though fleet of soot as Ladas, unless
he be be crazy meeding therefore the hellebore of Anticyra)
will pray for riches even with the gout. Two towns of this
name produced hellebore: one in Phokis on a bay (smus Anti-
tyranus) of the Corinthian gulf (Strabo 418 Antikyra, bearing
the same name with that on the Maliac gulf and mount Oeta3
here they say τὸν ἑλλέβορον φύεσθαι τὸν ἀστεῖον, ἐνταῦθα δέ
σκευάζεσθαι βέλτιον, καὶ διαὶ τοῦτο ἀποδημεῖν δεῦρο πολλούς, καθάρ-
σεως καὶ θεραπείας χάριν. black hellebore still grows in prosu-
sion on the hill above the site), the other on the Maliac gulf,
near the mouth of the Spercheus (Hdt. vu 198. Strabo 418.
428). cf. Hor. s. 11 3 82—3. 166.
