33 VETUS ATQUE ANTIQUA VI 21. antiquus is what was
long ago3 hence antiqui mores, the good old times, antiqui
amici those who were friends in days of yore, as Theseus and
Pirithous : vetus (1 132 n.) what has long been, hence inveterate,
experienced, velus militiae cet.: novus what is seen sor the
first time, strange )( antiquum recens fresh, which has lasted
but for a short time )( to vetus: Plaut. mil. 751 orationem
veterem atque antiquam. Freund s. v. antiquus: so πα-

35 OMBOS now Ix'zmz Ombu, the capital of the nomos or
(praefictura) Ombites (Ptin. V ξ 49), 30 m. p. north of Syene,
on the right bank of the Nile, in Upper Egypt or Thebais.
There are still ruins of two great temples at A⁷um Ombu and
Roman coins bearing a crocodile. ¹

TENTYRA 2 n. 76. now Denderalz (where are considerable
ruins of the old city), the capital of the nomos antyrzres
(Plin. v ἕ 49) in Upper Egypt on the left bank of the Nile.
As Ombi and Tentyra were more than 100 miles distant,
separated by five nomes and several important cities‚ they were
not finitimi or vicini (36). Iuv. is guilty of a gross error in
geography, but has assigned the battle to the most likely com-
batants. Ael. n. a. X 21 some Egyptians, as the Ombites,
reverence crocodiles; regarding them with the same admiration
as we do the gods of Olympus. If their children are carried
off by them, they often rejoice above measure, and go in solemn
procession, οἶα δήπου τεκοῦσαι θεῷ βοραῖν καὶ δεῖπνον. But the
ApollonopoliteS, a braneh of the Tentyrites, take the crocodiles
in nets, hang them from trees and flog them, then cut them up
and eat them. With the Ombites they are even familiar, and
such as are sed in the ponds which they have made, come
at call. They throw to them the heads of the creatures sacri-
fieed (for this part they will not eat themselves), and the
crocodiles leap about them. The Apollonopolites however hate
the crocodile. ib. ²4 (after deseribing the method of killing the
crocodile in Tentyra): these people are so active in hunting
them, ὠς τὸν ἐκεῖθι ποταμὸν εἰρήνην ἄγειν αὐτῶν βαθυτάτην.
>Here then they swim without sear and disport themselves in
swimming3 but amongst the Ombites or Coptites or Arsenoites
it is not easy even to bathe the feet, nor to draw water: nay
you may not even freely and without precaution wall< along the
river's banks. The Tentyrites reverence hawks ; the inhabitants
os Coptos then, intending to vex them as enemies of crocodiles,
often crucify hawks.
