THE Egyptians, who would deem it sacrilege to taste an
onion or a leek, have in our enlightened times been guilty of
barbarity which equals that of the nionsters of fable (1—32).
A festival at Ombi was lateiy iuterrupted by the Tentyrites:
one of whom, after his party had been put to flight, was over-
taken, torn in pieces and devoured (33—92). Other nations
are said to have fed on the flesh of man, but only when driven
to it by famine: rage and hate niove‘the Egyptians to crimes
which others only commit in the madness of despair (93—131).
Man is made for society and sympathy3 yet man has been
known to do what brute beasts will not do, to prey upon his
own kind (131—174).

The poet seems to have been led to choose this subject
partly by the hatred and contempt which Romans, aster the
battle of Actium, entertained sor the Egyptians (cf. I ¹26. 130.

of their manners (45 quamam ipse notavi).

With the whole satire compare [Quintil] decl. XII ‘pasti
cadaveris' (verses 2ο, 102, 122, with the notes).
