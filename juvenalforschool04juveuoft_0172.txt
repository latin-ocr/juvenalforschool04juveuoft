36 37 cf. xlv 100 n. some attributed the diversity of the
objects of local worship to the poliey of one of the Egyptian
kings, who thus broke up that unity among the people, which
might have been dangerous to the monarchy DS. 1 89 ἐξ 5 6.
In Plutarch’s time when the Oxyrhynchitae and Kynopolitae
had defied one another by killing and eating, each the obj eet

DCaSS. XLII 34 ἓ 2 θρησκεύουσί τε ’γὰρ πολλὰ [lepti οἱ Αἰγύπ-
τιοι]...καὶ πολέμους ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν καὶ πρὸς α’λλήλους, ἅτε
μὴ καθ’ ἓν ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἐναντιωτάτου καὶ αὐτοῖς
,τιμῶντές τινα, ἀναιροῦνται. Plin. V111 §3 92 93 describes the
mode of capture employed by the Tentyritae, adding that they
exerted a peculiar fascinating power upon the crocodile. Strabo
814-5 at Tentyra the crocodile is regarded as the most hateful
of beasts· , for while the other Egyptians, though aware of the
creature's vice and how destructive it is to mankind, still worship
and spare it, these track it out in every way and extirpate it.
They seem to have an antipathy to the crocodiles, so as to
suffer no harm from them, diving under thern and crossing them,
which no others dare do. &Vhen crocodiles were brought to
Rome sor exhibition, Tentyrites accompanied thern. A reservoir
was made with a stage at one side, on which the creatures might
bask‚ and it was the Tentyrites who drew them out in a net, going
into the water to them, and returning them into it.

Jewish (Iuv. XIV 100 n.), was opposed to the Roman principle :
