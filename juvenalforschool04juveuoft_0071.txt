A ‘ CONSOLATIO ' (παραμυθητικός cf. Sen. cons. ad Polyb. ad
Helv. ad Marc. Plut. cons. ad Apollon. ad uxor.) addressed to
Calvinus, who had been cheated of ten sestertia.

Guilt meets its due punishment, if not from corrupt judges,
yet from the conscience of the sinner and the reprobation of
honest men (1—6). But there are other considerations‚ Calvinus,
which should mollify your wrath. True, the friend whom you
trusted has defrauded you: but your fortune can well support so
trifling a loss. Look about you, and see how rife such crimes
are. In the golden days os Saturn‘s rule salsehood was unknown,
but now it is honesty that is the prodigy (7—85). Never was
perjury so universal: sor, while many believe in no God, others
hope sor a long reprieve, if not a final pardon (86—119). To
raise an outcry then, as though your case were hard and strange,
is as unreasonable as to wonder at blue eyes in a German, the
goltre among the Alps, dwarfs in the land ofpygmies(120—173).
Axe you then to look for no redress? Philosophy will teaeh
you that none but little minds delight in revenge: but, in any
case, you may be well content to leave the delinquent to his own
remorse and to that law by which crime breeds crime. If such
be your desire, you may yet sce him condemned to exile or to
death (im—249).

cf. Quintil. decl. 314.

This· satire was written in the year 127 A. D. 17 n. Its losty
Stoicisrn has made it a favorite with moralists ; many of the lines
are as vigorous as any in Iuv.‚ but the effect is marred by ver-
bosity. The aged poet forgets the cantion: manum de tabula.
Recitations had spoilt taste; the sense of proportion was lost;
the whole was sacrificed to the parts. It is true, not only of
Seneca, but of all silver age writers, that they ⁴ look best in quo-
tations.' The epigrams of Martial are the most perfect works of
silver age art, because in them point is in place, and there is no
temptation to digress. 39—52, 64—70‚ 78—85‚ extracts from
a common-place book on mythology and portents, remind one of
Lucan’s misplaced encyclopaedic learning.
