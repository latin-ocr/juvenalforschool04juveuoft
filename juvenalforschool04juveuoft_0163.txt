5 vimmo MAGICAE RESONANT UBI MEMNONE CHORDAE
Memnon in the Aethiopis of Arctinus, son of Aurora and Titho-
nus, slain by Achilles before Troy; he afterwards received the
gift of immortality. By the Alexandrine writers this legend was
connected with the statue of the king Amunoph ΙΙΙ. Pausan. 1
42 §2 ἀλλὰ ’γὰρ οὒ Μέμνονα οἱ Θηβαῖοι λέγουσι, Φαμένωφα δέ
εἶναι τῶν ἐγχωρίων, οὗ τοῦτο τὸ ἄγαλμα ἧν. cf. CIG 4727 ἔκλυον
αὐδήσαντος ἐγὼ ’πὺ λίθω Βάλβιλλα Ι φώνας τᾶς θείας M έμνο-
νος ἢ Φαμένωθ. The first writer who speaks of the musical
sound is Strabo 816, who himself heard it at dawn, but does not
call the statue Memnon's. He saw B.C. ²4 two colossal statues,
one erect, the other broken from its pedestal by an earthquake
(that recorded by Eus. a. u. c. 728:ss C. 26 Thelme Aegypti
usque ad solum dz'mtlaess it was from the portion of the latter
which remained on the base that the sound (ψόφος ὡς ἂν πληγῆς
οὐ μεγάλης) was believed to proceed. He was there with Aelius
Gallus and speaks with great cantion. Upon the statue may
now be traced the names of more than a hundred visitors, in-
cluding Hadrian and Sabina, the earliest of which inscriptions
belong to Α. D. 65, the latest to A.D. 1963 Hadrian and Sabina
paid a long visit A.D. 1303 his record is of imperial simplicity
(CIG 4728) IMPERAT· ΑΙ ΡΙΑΝΟΕ. The inscriptions, some
in verse, are in Gr. or Lat., except one which is supposed to be
Phoenician; they generally give the name of the witness, the
time of day (dawn, as befits the son of Aurora CIG 4747 ζώειν,
εἰναλίη Θέτι, Μέμνονα καὶ μέγα φωνεῖν Ι μάνθανε μητρῴῃ λαμ-
πάδι θαλπόμενον) and the year. XVhen the statue was re-
stored (probably by Septimus Severus, who carefully inspected
it Spartian. 17) it ceased to be vocal. Sir D. Brewster ‘ascribed
these sounds to the transmission of rarified air through the
crevices of a sonorous stone ...the sudden change of temperature
which takes place at the rising of the sun.' The same effect of
the mornffng heat on the chilled air in rock crevices was noticed
by Humboldt on the banks of the Oronooko. A very large
number of the inscriptions belong to Hadrian's reign, and so
does our satire. see CIG 4719—4761. CIL 111 30—66.
