It was said of Scipio Africanus Minor (Gell. ΙΙΙ 4§ 1) that he
cumesset reus, neque barbam desisse radi neque noncandida
veste uti neque ficisse cultu solito reorum. Quintil. XI 3
ἕ ¹74 it belongs to the peroration reos excitare, pueros
attollere, propinquos producere, vestes laniare.

PUPILLUM Suet. Galba 9 a tutor poisoned his pupillus,
to obtain the inheritance; Galba ordered him to be crucified:
when he appealed to the laws and declared himself a Roman
citizen, Galba, to save his dignity‚ ordered a cross to be brought
painted white and much higher than the rest.

Sen. ep. 97 ἓ 11 laetatur ille circumscriptione ficrloque nec
ante illi culpa quam culpae sorluna displicuit. The fraudulent
guardian might be deposed from his office by an accusatio
suspecti tutoris which was as old as the XII Tables, and might
be brought before the praetor (dig. XXVI 10 1), but not by
the pupillus himself ibid. 7. In the text therefore the ward
himself does not bring the action, he is not in his own tutela,
for he has not assumed the loga virilis, as his girlish locks
prove. After the ward arrived at the age of puberty, the
guardian was compelled to give him an account of the way
in which he had fulfilled his office, and to make good any losses
which the property had sustained Gaius 1 ξ 191. cod. V 51 2.
