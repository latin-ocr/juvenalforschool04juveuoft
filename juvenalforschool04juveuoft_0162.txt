Strabo 817 city of crocodiles τιμῶσα τὸ θηρίονε city of Apollo
πολεμοῦσα τοῖς κροκοδείλοις. 811 Arsinoe, formerly ‘city of
crocodiles;’ sor in this nome they exceedingly honour the
crocodile, and in this lake they have a sacred one, sed by him-
self, which is tame to the priests; it is called Suchos: it is
sed with bread, meat and wine, continually brought by strangers
who come to the sight. 812 for instance our host, a man of
distinction. as he shewed us the curiosities of the place (μυστα-
γωγῶν ἡμᾶς), went with us to the lake, taking from diuner a
cake and roast meat and jug of honey-and-water (μελικράτου).
We found the creature lying on the brink. The priests went
up to it, and some opened its mouth, while one put in the
cake, then the meat, and then poured in the μελίκρατον. The
crocodile then plunged into the lake and hastened to the other
side. NVhen another visitor came, likewise bearing an offering,
the priests ran round and came up to it and again in like
manner presented the gifts. Steph. Byz. Διόσπολις tame croco-
diles worshipt in caves and tanks. VVilkinson ane. Eg. 1 ser.

are extensive grottoes, cut sar into the limestone mountain,
where numerous crocodile mummies have been found, perfectly
preserved and evidently embalined with great care.’
